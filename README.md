# Introduction to JavaScript Hub
This repo contains the various introduction to JavaScript class examples and take it further exercises. It acts as a main hub for learning to work with JavaScript.

## JavaScript In-Class Demos
- Lightbulb Example: [Source Code](lightbulb/index.html) | [GitHub Pages](https://danstephenson.github.io/javascript-intro-hub/lightbulb/index.html)
<!-- - Change Events & Conditional Statements (Weather): [Source Code](color-change/index.html) [GitHub Pages](https://danstephenson.github.io/javascript-intro-hub/color-change/)-->


## Take It Further
These exercises are designed to give students practice using JavaScript outside of class. The exercises are not graded.

- [Emoji Picker and Keyboard Events] (https://danstephenson.github.io/javascript-intro-hub/take-it-further/emojis/)

## Experiments
These are JavaScript demos or projects that I am experimenting with. Most will be more fun than useful.
